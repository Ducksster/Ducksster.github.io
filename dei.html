                    <b><p>Sustainable Equity, Inclusion & Belonging </b></p>
                    <p>As a leading graduate institution of contemporary art and design,
                         The Yale School of Art recognizes its responsibility, privilege, 
                         and opportunity to contribute to culture and creativity in society
                          at large. The School commits to uphold principles of anti-racism, 
                          equity, diversity, and inclusion as integral to its mission, and 
                          will work towards achieving an educational environment that rejects 
                          inequity, advances social justice, and amplifies historically 
                          underrepresented voices. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The current enrolled School of Art population identifies as 62% 
                        students of color, the highest percentage among Yale’s professional 
                        schools. 18.25% identify as gender non-binary, non-confirming, or 
                        transgender, and the international student population is 29%. We aim 
                        to realize a vibrant, equitable, and sustainable future for our School
                         that assures accountability to our espoused values and principles of 
                         belonging for all students, faculty, staff, and alumni. This mission-critical 
                         unit plan requires Yale to confront violent histories upon which our institution
                          continues to benefit.
