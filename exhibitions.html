                    The School of Art galleries in Green Hall provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments of the School and the undergraduate program.

                    During exhibitions, Green Hall Gallery at 1156 Chapel Street is typically open to the public but due to COVID-19, it will remain open only to the Yale community until further notice.
