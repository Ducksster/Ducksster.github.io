                            The mission of the Yale School of Art is to provide students 
                            with intellectually informed, hands-on instruction in the practice 
                            of an array of visual arts media within the context of a liberal arts 
                            university. As a part of the first institution of higher learning to 
                            successfully integrate a studio-based education into such a broad 
                            pedagogical framework, the Yale School of Art has a long and distinguished 
                            history of training artists of the highest caliber. A full-time faculty of 
                            working artists in conjunction with a diverse cross-section of accomplished 
                            visiting artists collaborate to design a program and foster an environment 
                            where the unique talents and perspectives of individual students can emerge and flourish.
                        </p>

                            The School of Art is founded on the belief that art is a fundamental force 
                            in national and international culture, and that one of the primary standards 
                            by which societies are judged is the quality, creative freedom, critical insight, 
                            and formal and technical innovation of the visual art they produce. The Yale School 
                            of Art teaches at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and consequently the student
                            body consists of those whose primary or exclusive focus is art as well as those for 
                            whom art is an essential part of a varied course of inquiry. The school currently 
                            offers degrees and undergraduate majors in the areas of graphic design, painting/printmaking, photography, and sculpture.
